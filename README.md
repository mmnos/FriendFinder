# FriendFinder

## Overview

This app allows the user to answer 10 questions on scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Once all of the questions are filled out and submitted, it will find the user's best match based on how they answered the questions.

## How It Works

The app will get the closest match based on the difference of score from what the user has inputted and compare it to the scores in the friends file. It uses get and post requests to retrieve and compare data than adds the new user to the api.
